Confused? Can't figure out which movie to watch next?
Here's the solution! Just click on the link of my "Movie
Guide" website and enter the movie name that you have watched 
recently and BOOM! my advance Machine Learning enabled website
will suggest you the movie name that you should watch next
according to you taste based on which movie you have recently 
watched.

Note: Open the web apllication preferably on Google Chrome.

## Documentation

This intelligent movie recommend system works on an advance
machine learning model which learns the taste of a perticular
user by collecting relevant data of his/her recently watched
movies.

For example, if a user recently watched a movie named "Toy Story"
and that person enters the name of that movie on my website, 
then the machine learning model behind the sences captures the name
of that perticular movie and fetch the name of that movie so that
it can firstly look for any available sequal of that movie.


Then the ML model also looks for the other movies with similar 
cast, crew, release date-month-year and most importantly the 
genre matching to the movie the user has recently watched.


## Tech Used
cosine_similarity and cosine_distance is used to make this advance
recommendation system.

Formula : 1 - cosine_similarity = cosine_distance

## Lessons Learned

Learned how to use cosine_similarity to get a better recommendation
based on the taste of every particular user.

Also leanred about ML model implementation using Streamlit
framework wich is very convinient for those who doesn't know
much about web-development.
